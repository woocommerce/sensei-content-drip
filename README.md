**User problems:**
- users downloading all content then getting a refund (protects revenue)
- students not spending enough time on basic topics before rushing into more advanced lessons (structured learning)

Solution:
-------

**Basic Features:**

- When adding a lesson to a course, you can choose a time period after which you want the lesson to become available.
- Until that time period has passed, the lesson content will be hidden, with a message saying “This lesson will be available on: xx/xx/xx”


**Additional  Features**
--------------
- Set ‘absolute times’ so you can use it to schedule “live” courses, which are taken in real time, so you can enrol people for a course say in March, and the course begins on April 1st by setting lesson 1 to be available on that date, then lesson 2 a week later etc. 
- Optionally remove access after a certain date (possibly require a course expiration feature). **Dwain**:  *This should be in core *
- Requested: As well as using a fixed time period, access could be granted to next lesson by spending a specified amount of time studying a lesson (probably impractical, as they could just leave the lesson open in the browser until the time is reached) **Dwain:** the test should ensure that the user covered the course so not needed.

**Considerations**
-------------------
- If in future we want to enable one lesson to be used in multiple courses, we’d potentially need a way to set the drip schedule for a lesson separately for each course it belongs to?
- Integration with Modules? If modules is activated then you could optionally set a schedule for modules instead of lessons, then every lesson in the module would become available at the same time. Possibly not necessary?
Ideally coincide this with email notifications so that users get an email when the next lesson is available.
- From a comment on the ideas board - “One of the most important feature that many people over look is that of pausing. The best policy is that if a customer has paid for certain product they should be allowed access to that product but lets say the credit card expires or something and their subscription cancels or may be they want to pause their subscription for a month. Content drip software doesn't remember their progress. So they have to start from ground zero. If you had this feature straight of the bat you would save yourself having to solve this problem in feature releases. :-)” Example Usage e.g. Purchase course and Lesson 1 is available immediately. Lesson 2 is available after 1 week, Lesson 3 after 2 weeks etc.
